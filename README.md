this uses the [auto-editor](https://github.com/wyattblue/auto-editor) package :D

read [this site](https://auto-editor.com/ref/options) to see on how to use extra parameters, and yes you need to put `--` infront of each one, including the beginning one.
example: `--export premiere`, `--export resolve`

**if on windows**
<br>all you have to do is install [python3](https://python.org) and then type `pip install auto-editor` in cmd and thats it! you can run the python file in the source code or use the exe file (both work!) :D

**if on mac/linux**
<br>go to your terminal and type `pip install auto-editor`, and `pip install tkinterdnd2`, then install the `main.py` file from this repo, using the `download raw file` button, and then run the script and your also good.
