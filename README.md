it uses the [auto-editor](https://github.com/wyattblue/auto-editor) package and all you have to do is install [python3](https://python.org) and then type `pip install auto-editor` and thats it! you can run the python file in the source code or use the exe file (both work!) :D

read [this site](https://auto-editor.com/ref/options) to see on how to use extra parameters
